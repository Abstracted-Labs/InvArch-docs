# Smart IP Staking

## Smart contract as IPS

- By storing smart contracts as IPs, InvArch provides a mechanism for smart contract authentication -> a way for developers to protect their code.


## IP Staking

- As already known, InvArch is an IP management protocol, but with this functionality, InvArch would also serve as a protocol for incentivize open-source.

## Use case example

> Smart IP Staking:
Decentralized Ownership Book Publishing app -> 100 IPTs distributed equally between Alice, Bob, Charlie and Dave.
And Eve and Ferdie nominate 100 VArch each to the app.
App now has a 200 VArch stake in the active set of Smart IP staking.
In era 1 the app got 50 VArch in rewards, each one of us gets 11.25 VArch and the nominators get 2.5 each

> This is the basic structure of Smart IP staking, the numbers are just an example, the important part is that the IPT allocation is dynamic and programmable.

> I can now go ahead and sell 10% of my IPTs, which now have on-chain value based on their rentability in staking.

> Plus their off-chain and inside contract value.
