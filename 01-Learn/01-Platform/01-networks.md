# Networks

We plan to deploy InvArch on Polkadot Network. Significalty, we would have testnet and also canary network on Kusama Network if it would be needed down the road.

Our roadmap in regards to deployments as a parachain is the following:

* InvArch Tinker Alpha: InvArch hosted parachain TestNet (July 2022)
* InvArch Tinker Beta: deployment on the Rococo TestNet (September 2022)
* InvArch Tinker: Deployment on Kusama (October 2022)
* InvArch: Deployment on Polkadot (end of Q4 2022)

This strategy allows us to de-risk software upgrades to InvArch on the Polkadot MainNet while still maintaining a reasonable update velocity. We will add details on how to access different InvArch-based networks as the networks become available.

## InvArch Tinker Alpha

This TestNet is a network hosted by InvArch. It features a parachain/ relay chain scheme. The goal is to allow developers to test the Ethereum compatibility feature of InvArch in a shared parachain environment without needing to run their own nodes or network.

## InvArch Tinker Beta

We decide to utilize the Rococo as the public testnet because it is now become a [community testbed](https://polkadot.network/blog/rococo-revamp-becoming-a-community-parachain-testbed/) and foster the security on the ongoing upgrades of InvArch architecture layers.

## InvArch Tinker

In advance of deploying to the Polkadot MainNet, InvArch would launch Tinker as a parachain on the Kusama network. The parachain functionality would be live on Kusama and featues are progerssively being released according the InvArch Tinker launch schedule.

We plan to exercise parachain-related functionality such as [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain) and [SPREE](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-spree) on InvArch Tinker.

## InvArch Polkadot MainNet

The InvArch production MainNet will be deployed as a parachain on Polkadot. This InvArch network will feature the highest levels of security and availability. Code running on the MainNet will generally have been vetted through one or more of the other networks listed above.
