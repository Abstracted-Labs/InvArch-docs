# Networks

We plan to deploy InvArch on Polkadot Network. Significalty, we would have testnet and also canary network on Kusama Network if it would be needed down the road.

Our roadmap in regards to deployments as a parachain is the following:

* Tinker Testnet: InvArch hosted parachain TestNet (May 2022)
* Tinkernet Parachain: Deployment on Kusama Relay Chain (Q3 2022)
* InvArch Parachain: Deployment on Polkadot Relay Chain (end of Q4 2022)

This strategy allows us to de-risk software upgrades to InvArch on the Polkadot MainNet while still maintaining a reasonable update velocity. We will add details on how to access different InvArch-based networks as the networks become available.

## Brainstorm Testnet

We decide to utilize the Rococo as the public testnet because it is now become a [community testbed](https://polkadot.network/blog/rococo-revamp-becoming-a-community-parachain-testbed/) and foster the security on the ongoing upgrades of InvArch architecture layers.

## Tinkernet Parachain

In advance of deploying to the Polkadot MainNet, InvArch would launch Tinkernet as a parachain on the Kusama network. The parachain functionality would be live on Kusama and featues are progerssively being released according the InvArch Tinker launch schedule.

We plan to exercise parachain-related functionality such as [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain) and [SPREE](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-spree) on InvArch Tinker.

## InvArch Parachain

The InvArch production MainNet will be deployed as a parachain on Polkadot. This InvArch network will feature the highest levels of security and availability. Code running on the MainNet will generally have been vetted through one or more of the other networks listed above.
