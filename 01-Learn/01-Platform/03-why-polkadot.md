# Why We're Builing on Polkadot

After extensive research, we decide to build InvArch using the Substrate development framework and deploy InvArch as a parachain on the Polkadot network.

## Substrate Blockchain Framework

Substrate is a good technical fit for InvArch. By building on top of this framework, we can leverage the extensive functionality that Substrate includes out-of-the-box, rather than building it ourselves. This includes per-to-peer networking, consensus mechanisms, governance functionality, EVM implementation, and many more.

Overall, using Substrate will dramatically reduce the time and implementation effort needed to implement InvArch. Substrate allows a great degree of customization, which is necessary in order to achieve our Ethereum compatibility goals. And, by using Rust, we benefit from both safety guarantees and performance gains.

## Polkadot Network and Ecosystem

The Polkadot Network is also a good fit for InvArch. As a parachain on Polkadot, InvArch will be able to directly integrate with -- and move tokens between -- any other parachains and parathreads on the network.

We can also leverage any of the bridges that are independently built to connect non-Polkadot chains to Polkadot, including bridges to Ethereum and any other non-Substrate chains. Polkadot's interoperability model uniquely supports InvArch's cross-chain integration goals and is a key enabling technology to support the InvArch vision.

But perhaps just as important as the technical criteria above, we are impressed with the community in the Polkadot ecosystem. This includes individuals at Parity, the Web3 Foundation, and other projects within the ecosystem. We have built many valuable relationships and find the people to be both extremely talented, helpful and the kind of people we want to be around.
