# Roadmap

InvArch is still being actively developed.

On Q3 2021, we did team procurement and published the InvArch whitepaper. We were also develop custom Substrate pallets for IP tokenization.

On Q4 2021, InvArch secured Web3 Foundation Grant, continuing the team expansion, complete the seed round and integrate EVM integration to support smart contract functionality.

On Q1 20222, we plan to implement KYC & oracle integrations, realize IP & dApp Staking Mechanism, Public Valuation Mechanism, and smart contract functionality using Ink!.

The roughly roadmap beyond that is to launch our testnet, rollout InvArch governance system, InvArch Builder Program, and secure a Polkadot Parachain slot.
