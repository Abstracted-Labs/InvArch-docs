# Tokens

As an IP Management with smart contract functionality for Polkadot ecosystem, InvArch requires a utility token to function.

This token is central to the design of InvArch and cannot be removed without sacrificeing essential functionality. The InvArch token uses includes:

* Minting intellectual property sets
* Supporting the gas metering of smart contract execution
* Incentivising collators and powering the mechanics around the creation of a decentralized node infrastructure on which the platform can run
* Facilitating the onchain governance mechanism, including proposing referenda, electing council members, voting, etc.
* Forming decentralized ventures
* Paying network transaction fees
* And many more
