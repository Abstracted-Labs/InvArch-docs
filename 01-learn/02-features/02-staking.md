# OCIF Protocol

The On-Chain Innovation Funding (OCIF) protocol breathes new life into development & helps fuel innovation by directly incentivizing developers & creators of IP Sets. This includes the ability to stake IP Sets to the network in exchange for network fees (IP Staking), the ability to provide IP Tokens in exchange for staking rewards & establish IPT liquidity (IP Farming), and the ability to receive donated staking rewards in the form of a grant that is delivered to an IP Set (IP Donating).

### IP staking

On-Chain Staking For dApps, DAOs, Smart Contracts, & Other IP Set Based Assets. Individuals Can Elect To Stake Toward Projects, Proposals, & Other Technology Built On InvArch.\
\
IP Staking allows users to propose their intellectual property (stored as an IP Set) to the InvArch network & the world, making them available to receive community feedback & network funds. It is a no-barrier entry method for sharing ideas with the world & fueling funding. It provides an immediate, immutable, & transparent platform for exposure, receiving community feedback, and then receiving funding allocations based on the feedback received.\
\
Instead of individuals selecting a network Collator to stake their network tokens toward in exchange for staking rewards, this process is circumvented & replaced with the practice of instead choosing an IP set or a dApp (or smart contract) to stake towards. By staking to it, users allocate their voting weight (their share of network tokens compared to others) toward that project. Finally, fees generated by the network are then proportionately reallocated towards staked dApps depending on the total weight of their votes.

### **IP Farming**

Built-In Liquidity Tools For dApps, DAOs, & IP Tokens. Individuals Can Elect To Allocate Some Or All Of Their Staking Rewards Toward A Staked IP Set In Exchange For A Set Yield Of Its IP Tokens.\
\
IP Farming brings a platform to establish liquidity, user base, & decentralized governance needs for startup endeavors by allowing controlled crowdfunding campaigns to be launched & managed entirely on-chain! IP Set Owners can define a minimum & maximum range of network tokens they would like to raise, the total percentage or rate of pegged IP Tokens they will provide in exchange & the utility of those IPTs.

### **IP Donations**

Full Or Partial Donations Of Staking Rewards For dApps, DAOs, Smart Contracts, & Other IP Set Based Assets. Users Can Select IP & Proposals Built On InvArch To Support.\
\
IP Donations allows users to either receive or contribute towards the funding & support of on-chain grants that are funded via on-chain donations. A pure-of-heart (and possibly tax-deductible) approach to bringing philanthropy-style funding opportunities to the entire world.

## Reward Distribution

Collators are rewarded at the end of every round (300 blocks) for their work from 2 rounds ago.

The distribution of the 5% annual inflation goes as follows:

* 1% goes to incentivizing collators
* 1.5% goes to the parachain bond reserve
* The remaining 2.5% will go to users that stake their tokens

Out of that 2.5%, collators gets the rewards corresponding to their stake in the network.The rest are distributed among nominators by stake.

Mathematically speaking, for collators, the reward distribution per block proposed and finalized would look like this:

```
 reward = (0.2 x amount _due) + (0.5 x amount_due x stake)
```

Where `amount_due` is the corresponding inflation being distributed in a specific block, the `stake` corresponds to the number of tokens bonded by the collator in respect to the total stake of that collator (accounting nominations).

For each nominator, the reward distribution (per block proposed and finalized by the nominated collator) would look like this:

```
    reward = (0.5 x amount_due x stake)
```

Where `amount_due` is the corresponding inflation being distributed in a specific block, the `stake` corresponds to the amount of tokens bonded by each nominator in respect to the total stake of that collator.
