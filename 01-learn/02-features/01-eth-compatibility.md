# INV4 Protocol

The Invention, Involvement, Inventory, & Investment (INV4) protocol provides the foundation & structure for all assets on the InvArch network. This includes data that represents individual files of information (IP Files), collections of interchangeable files organized in sets (IP Sets), pegged fungible assets & sub-assets (IP Tokens), and pegged licensing agreements that define & record copyright ownership.

### IP Files

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are used to represent an immutable record & proof of ownership of unique items such as digital art, real estate, and physical goods \[3]. InvArch builds on this technology in several key ways using a new & enhanced NFT class called Intellectual Property Files, also known as IP Files or IPFs. IP Files are non-fungible assets used to certify the existence & authenticity (compared to ownership) of a digital file, protect the uniqueness of an asset, and streamline its management rights.

### IP Sets

NFT collections typically serve to categorize non-fungible assets together around a common theme & typically bind them to the collection forever. InvArch features a similar grouping system for IP Files; however, with more relaxed restrictions & expanded capabilities. InvArch features truly composable & interchangeable collections of IPFs called Intellectual Property Sets, which allow different IPFs (regardless of their original IP Set) to co-exist in any IP Set, be utilized independently, and be assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements. Unrestricted file composability allows anyone using InvArch to take existing programs, modules, & data, and adapt or build on top of them.

### IP Tokens

InvArch institutes completely programmable fungible tokens that can be pegged to an IP Set called Intellectual Property Tokens, also known as IP Tokens or IPTs. Similar to ERC20 fungible tokens, IP Tokens have a property that makes each token exactly the same (in type and value). As a result, IP Sets can deploy IPTs in a very similar manner to how dApps utilize their utility tokens. IP Tokens realize an unrestricted possibility of use-cases such as assigning (exclusive or fractional) ownership rights, seamless royalty allocations, providing access rights & authorization tiers over data, deciding voting weight in a DAO or community governing IP, extending exclusive functionality, providing native currencies for IP-based dApps, & streamlining copyright licensing agreements.
