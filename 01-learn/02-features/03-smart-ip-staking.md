# XCA Protocol

The Cross-Chain Authentication (XCA) protocol taps into the power of the Polkadot network to unleash some of the most potent & unrealized abilities of Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM) technology. The power of InvArch will be extended to other Parachains on the Polkadot relay via its XCINV4 Modules, which provide native support for IP Assets.

In tandem, the InvArch Parachain will also be connected to the Polkadot relay. Whenever an IP File is minted anywhere throughout the ecosystem, a record of the IP File (which consists of a CID & other various hash-based IDs) is sent to InvArch through the Polkadot relay. Then, it is then indexed & cross-referenced against other IP Files.
