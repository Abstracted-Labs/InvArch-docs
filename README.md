# Welcome to InvArch

![Main Page Banner](assets/cover.png)

This site provides documentation for InvArch, an IP management and development protocol parachain on the Polkadot network that is fully Ethereum compatible. Here, you'll find both high-level and technical information for developers, collators, end-users, and other InvArch network participants.

This site will grow and be refined over time as InvArch is developed. We welcome you to join the InvArch community and contribute to this site and to the project.

## What is InvArch?

InvArch is an IP management and development protocol with smart contract functionality. It is a future Polkadot parachain that will allow users to tokenize their ideas and developers to build new and exciting applications that utilize this database.

InvArch will also be a parachain on the Polkadot network. That means it will get shared security from the Polkadot relay chain and will be able to integrate with other chains that are connected to Polkadot (once that functionality is available on Polkadot).
