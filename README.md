## What is InvArch?

InvArch is an IP ownership, utility and cross-chain authentication protocol with SmartIP functionality. It is a future Polkadot parachain that will allow users to tokenize their ideas and developers to build new and exciting applications that utilize this database and also cross-chain authentication.

InvArch will also be a parachain on the Polkadot network. That means it will get shared security from the Polkadot relay chain and will be able to integrate with other chains that are connected to Polkadot.
